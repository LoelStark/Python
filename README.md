# Meme_Generator

undr this repo (also unfinished)
I included multiple files and scripts
(Mor files will be uploaded soon!)

# Flask & Python
I found an API on github and it can help with meme generation
The only other person I saw doing this was the network chuck, he's available on youtube, amazing projects too
I was learning and included flask because of its simplicity and lightweight functionality
I import the flask in the python script (well its a framework how else will I use it in this project)
THere will be an HTML file in a templates directory

# Meme Generation website
The aim of the site is to generate a random meme every 30 seconds
as mentioned before, the memes will be taken from Reddit
